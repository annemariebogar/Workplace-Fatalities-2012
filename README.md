**Author:** Anne Marie Bogar
**Active Project Dates:** February 25 - March 10, 2024<br/>

## Summary
The goal of the project is to use visualizations in Power BI to explore a dataset about workplace fatalities in each state in the year 2012. 
The graphs, filters and interactivity help the audience detect correlations and gain interesting insights into the relationships between the different features in the dataset. 
Statistical analysis, such as logistic regression and hypothesis testing, is used to confirm the findings in the graphs.

## Data
The data is from a CSV file containing information about workplace fatalities in each state in the year 2012. 
The information contained in the file for each state consists of:
1. The total number of workplace fatalities in 2012
2. The rate of workplace fatalities in 2012
3. The stateâ€™s rank in terms of workplace fatalities for 2012
4. The total number of workplace injuries and/or illnesses in 2012
5. The rate of workplace injuries and/or illnesses in 2012
6. The penalties, or average amount of dollars the state was fined, in 2013
7. The state rank for penalty amounts in 2013
8. The number of inspectors in the state for conducting workplace inspections
9. The number of years it takes to inspect each workplace once
10. Whether the program that inspects the workplaces is state-run or federal-run
